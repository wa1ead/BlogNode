You may even find this code ready to go. This is the exact same buffer code that I used in my CS50x problem paper on streams. It doesn't include buffer headers, buffer sizes, and all of the fancy stuff, but this code is completely decoupled from the entire stream processing framework, which means that it can be used in whatever stream processing scenario you'd like it for.

Streams are streams are streams

The Stream API is extremely well-defined and the stream processing framework, OpenMP, has a good standard library that can work out the complicated details of defining the stream. If you want to start writing your own stream processing code, you'll probably need to take a little time to
